The Galthrax—parasitic conquerors who feed on high-energy lifeforms—ravaged Elyndor, hunting the Vherin to the brink of extinction. In a desperate escape, only a few hundred Vherin fled across the galaxy. Their journey ended on Earth, a primitive world where they hoped to hide among its unsuspecting inhabitants. Their powers, once a gift, have become a curse: gravity shaping, light weaving, sonic bending, emotional projection, and more—abilities that make them targets both for the Galthrax and for human governments eager to exploit or weaponize them.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</body>\n</html>"

The Galthrax—parasitic conquerors who feed on high-energy lifeforms—ravaged Elyndor, hunting the Vherin to the brink of extinction. In a desperate escape, only a few hundred Vherin fled across the galaxy. Their journey ended on Earth, a primitive world where they hoped to hide among its unsuspecting inhabitants. Their powers, once a gift, have become a curse: gravity shaping, light weaving, sonic bending, emotional projection, and more—abilities that make them targets both for the Galthrax and for human governments eager to exploit or weaponize them.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\"\n          }\n    ]\n}"
